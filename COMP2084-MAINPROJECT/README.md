The project is about a simple recipe organizer that’ll allow the user to create recipes by providing information such as ingredients, step-by-step cooking procedures, and the total cooking time. 

The user will be able to log in and access their saved recipes anytime, anywhere.

the application will prove helpful for beginners in cooking who usually have a hard time keeping track of all the recipes they come across. 

It will provide a simple and user-friendly platform to create, update, and delete the recipes and sync data to their account, thus implementing CRUD functionality.
